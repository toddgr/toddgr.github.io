This is a 2D platformer I made with [Andrew Scheafer]() for the Pixel Game Jam 2024. The concept, all of the assets and animations, and everything else was made from scratch in 10 days. You can [download it](https://igraceykay.itch.io/aquaquest) or see the official itch.io page [here](https://igraceykay.itch.io/aquaquest).
