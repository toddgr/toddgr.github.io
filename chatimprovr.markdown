> A virtual reality game engine designed entirely in the Rust programming language. 

ChatImproVR is a Rust-focused game engine that my team designed with virtual reality in mind. We implemented an Entity Component System architecture, and integrated it on multiple platforms-- from VR headsets to laptops.

      This was my senior Capstone project for my Bachelor's degree. As a part of the ChatImproVR team, I was responsible for developing the graphics system, and I helped to design a few of the mini games that we made to demonstrate our game engine at the Oregon State University 2023 Engineering Expo. Before this project, I had only ever programmed computer graphics in C++ with OpenGL, so it was interesting to learn how to develop a computer graphics system in a newer language.

I also made a promotional video for the team that goes into more detail. You can view it here:
