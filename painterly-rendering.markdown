### *aka Generating & Manipulating Painterly Renderings of Images*

---

As part of my Honors Bachelor's degree, I completed an undergraduate thesis in which I developed a program that takes in any image and allows the user to apply different painterly styles. 

<table style="border-collapse: collapse; border: none;">
  <tr style="border: none;">
    <td style="border: none;">
      To achieve these effects, I worked with OpenGL in C++ and used a GLUI to achieve the user interface. While the UI is fairly straightforward and not very aesthetically pleasing, it allowed me to demonstrate the complete spectrum of the project's capabilities.

I worked on this project over the span of four years, throughout my entire undergraduate career. I learned so much from completing and defending this thesis, from the inner workings of OpenGL and the computer graphics pipeline to long-term project management, all of which I am using to develop my Masters thesis.

In addition to the software, I also wrote and defended a thesis, which was published by the Honors College at Oregon State. You can view my thesis [here](https://ir.library.oregonstate.edu/concern/honors_college_theses/bn999f86n?locale=en), or you can view my defense presentation here:
